                        <div class="story-narrative">
                            <p class="story-paragraph">Five years ago, I was exactly where many of my clients are today. I had what looked like a successful career in corporate consulting, climbing the ladder, checking all the boxes that society told me meant "success." But inside, I was running on empty.</p>
                            
                            <p class="story-paragraph">The 60-hour weeks, constant pressure, and never-ending demands had left me exhausted, cynical, and disconnected from the passion that once drove me. I was experiencing classic burnout, but I didn't recognize it at the time. I just thought this was what "success" was supposed to feel like.</p>
                            
                            <p class="story-paragraph">The turning point came during what should have been a celebrationâ€”a major promotion. Instead of feeling accomplished, I felt empty. That night, I realized I had been so focused on external achievements that I had lost touch with what truly mattered to me.</p>
                            
                            <p class="story-paragraph">My journey back to vitality wasn't quick or easy. It required me to completely reimagine what success looked like, develop new boundaries, and learn to honor my own needs while still achieving meaningful goals. Through therapy, coaching, mindfulness practices, and a lot of trial and error, I discovered that it was possible to be both successful and fulfilled.</p>
                            
                            <p class="story-paragraph">This transformation was so profound that I knew I had to help others navigate their own path from burnout to brilliance. I left my corporate role, pursued extensive training in coaching and burnout recovery, and founded my practice to guide other professionals through this same journey.</p>
