                    <p class="post-subtitle">Burnout doesn't happen overnight. It's a slow burn, a gradual erosion of your energy, passion, and well-being. The good news is that there are early warning signs that can help you catch it before it consumes you. Here are five to watch out for.</p>

                        <h2>1. Persistent Exhaustion</h2>
                        <p>This isn't just feeling tired after a long week. This is a deep, bone-weary exhaustion that doesn't go away, even after a good night's sleep. It's a feeling of being emotionally, mentally, and physically drained.</p>
                        <p><strong>How to address it:</strong> Prioritize rest. This might mean saying no to social commitments, taking a day off work, or simply scheduling a non-negotiable hour of downtime each day. It's also important to look at your sleep habits. Are you getting enough quality sleep? If not, what can you do to improve it?</p>

                        <h2>2. Cynicism and Detachment</h2>
                        <p>You used to love your job, but now you feel cynical and detached. You might find yourself being sarcastic or critical, or you might feel a sense of dread when you think about work. This is a sign that you're emotionally distancing yourself to cope with the stress.</p>
                        <p><strong>How to address it:</strong> Reconnect with your "why." Why did you choose this career in the first place? What used to excite you about it? Try to find small ways to reconnect with the parts of your job that you enjoy. It's also important to talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling.</p>

                        <h2>3. A Sense of Ineffectiveness</h2>
                        <p>You feel like you're not making a difference, no matter how hard you work. You might doubt your abilities and feel like a fraud. This is a classic sign of burnout, and it can be incredibly demotivating.</p>
                        <p><strong>How to address it:</strong> Celebrate small wins. At the end of each day, write down three things you accomplished, no matter how small. This can help you to see that you are making progress, even when it doesn't feel like it. It's also important to ask for feedback from your manager or a trusted colleague. They can help you to see your contributions more clearly.</p>

                        <h2>4. Physical Symptoms</h2>
                        <p>Burnout isn't just in your head; it can manifest in your body as well. You might experience headaches, stomach problems, or other physical ailments. You might also find that you're getting sick more often than usual.</p>
                        <p><strong>How to address it:</strong> Take care of your body. This means eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and making time for relaxation. It's also important to see a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions.</p>

                        <h2>5. Neglecting Your Own Needs</h2>
                        <p>You're so focused on work that you're neglecting your own needs. You might be skipping meals, not getting enough exercise, or not making time for hobbies and relationships. This is a sign that you're not prioritizing your own well-being.</p>
                        <p><strong>How to address it:</strong> Make time for yourself. Schedule time for activities that you enjoy, and that help you to relax and recharge. This might be anything from reading a book to taking a bath to spending time in nature. Remember, you can't pour from an empty cup.</p>
