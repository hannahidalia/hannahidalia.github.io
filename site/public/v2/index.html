                        <p>My own journey through the high-pressure world of corporate leadership led me to a profound realization: traditional success metrics are not enough. After experiencing my own burnout, I dedicated myself to mastering the somatic and psycho-spiritual tools that create sustainable, fulfilling success. Now, I guide other women leaders on this same path, helping them reclaim their power and lead from a place of true embodiment.</p>
