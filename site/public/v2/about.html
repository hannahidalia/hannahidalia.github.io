                        <h2>From High-Stakes Boardrooms to Embodied Wisdom</h2>
                        <p>Like many of my clients, my career began in the fast-paced world of corporate strategy. I thrived on the pressure, the intellectual challenge, and the tangible wins. From the outside, I was the picture of success. On the inside, I was running on empty, disconnected from myself and the work that once brought me joy.</p>
                        
                        <p>My turning point wasn't a single event, but a slow, creeping realization that the relentless pursuit of 'more' was leading me further away from the impact and fulfillment I truly craved. I knew there had to be a different way to lead—one that didn't demand the sacrifice of my own well-being.</p>

                        <blockquote>"I discovered that the key to sustainable leadership wasn't in a new strategy, but in a new state of being."</blockquote>
                        
                        <p>This realization sparked a deep dive into the worlds of somatic psychology, biodynamic craniosacral therapy, and psycho-spiritual development. I wasn't just learning new techniques; I was fundamentally rewiring my own nervous system and rediscovering a source of wisdom within me that was far more powerful than any external validation. I learned to lead not from my head, but from a place of deep, embodied knowing.</p>

                        <p>My mission now is to guide other women in high-stakes roles back to themselves. I provide the tools and the dedicated support to help you move from burnout to brilliance, from self-doubt to self-trust, and to lead with the authentic, unshakeable presence that is your birthright.</p>

                            <p>I believe that true leadership is an inside-out job. It's about cultivating a deep sense of inner safety and alignment, so you can meet any external challenge with grace and clarity. My approach blends cutting-edge neuroscience with ancient wisdom to create profound and lasting transformation.</p>
