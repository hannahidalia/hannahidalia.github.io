            <h2>About Hannah and the Embodied Leadership Program</h2>
            <p>At the core of the Embodied Leadership Program is the belief that leadership starts with self-mastery. This program was designed by Hannah, a seasoned expert in emotional intelligence, psycho-spiritual integration, and somatic healing, to support women in navigating the challenges of high-pressure leadership roles with grace, clarity, and resilience.</p>
            
            <h3>Meet Hannah: A Leader in Emotional and Somatic Healing</h3>
            <p>Hannah’s path to creating the Embodied Leadership Program is deeply personal. She saw the need for an approach that goes beyond traditional leadership training. With over a decade of experience in biodynamic craniosacral therapy, prenatal and perinatal psychology, and somatic healing, Hannah has developed a framework that blends mind-body techniques with leadership strategies for women in high-stakes roles.</p>
            
            <h3>The Philosophy Behind Embodied Leadership</h3>
            <p>Embodied leadership is more than just mental resilience—it’s about leading with the whole self—body, mind, and spirit. At its core, the program focuses on helping women reconnect with their nervous systems, release unconscious emotional patterns, and align their leadership with their deeper purpose.</p>
            
            <h3>Why Choose This Program?</h3>
            <p>Hannah’s program combines practical leadership skills with deep emotional healing, providing a unique opportunity for women leaders to embody their leadership potential. Whether you're dealing with burnout, stress, or emotional overwhelm, this program offers a personalized, somatic, and spiritual approach to growth.</p>
