# 02: About Page Design Specification

The About Page is crucial for building trust and personal connection. It's an opportunity to move beyond the service and connect with the visitor on a human level. The goal is to tell Hannah's story in a way that builds authority while also making her relatable to her target audience of high-achieving leaders.

**Guiding Principle:** Hannah's story should not just be about her; it should be a mirror reflecting the journey and aspirations of her ideal client.

### **1. Hero Section**

*   **Purpose:** To set a personal and professional tone.
*   **Visuals:** A strong, confident, yet approachable photograph of Hannah. This should be different from the homepage photo, perhaps showing more of her personality.
*   **Headline:** A quote or statement that encapsulates her mission.
    *   *e.g., "I believe the most powerful leadership isn't learned, it's embodied."*

### **2. The Story: From Burnout to Embodiment**

*   **Purpose:** To tell Hannah's personal story, directly connecting her experiences to the problems her clients face. This is the core of the page.
*   **Structure:** A compelling, well-written narrative broken into scannable paragraphs with clear subheadings.
*   **Key Narrative Points:**
    *   **The "Before":** Start by establishing her in a relatable, high-stakes environment (e.g., "Like many of my clients, my career began in the fast-paced world of..."). Describe the external success paired with the internal struggleâ€”the burnout, the pressure, the feeling of being disconnected. This validates the client's own experience.
    *   **The Turning Point:** Describe the moment or period that catalyzed her change. What was the catalyst that made her realize the traditional path was unsustainable? This creates intrigue and shows vulnerability.
    *   **The Discovery:** Detail her journey into somatic work, psycho-spiritual development, etc. **Crucially, frame this as a search for a solution, not just a random interest.** Use the translated, benefit-focused language established in the site strategy.
    *   **The "After" / The Mission:** Connect her transformation to her current work. Explain *why* she is so passionate about helping other women leaders avoid the pitfalls she experienced. Frame her business as a mission.
*   **Formatting:**
    *   Use **pull quotes** to highlight powerful sentences (e.g., *"I discovered that the key to sustainable leadership wasn't in a new strategy, but in a new state of being."*).
    *   Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences).

### **3. Professional Bio & Credentials**

*   **Purpose:** To build authority and credibility after establishing a personal connection.
*   **Structure:** A more formal, concise section. This can be a sidebar or a clearly delineated section following the story.
*   **Content:**
    *   Formal education and degrees.
    *   Relevant certifications (coaching, somatic therapies, etc.).
    *   Years of experience.
    *   Any major publications, speaking engagements, or awards.
    *   A professional headshot.
*   **Headline:** `My Professional Background` or `The Formal Bio`.

---

### **4. My Philosophy & Approach**

*   **Purpose:** To provide a slightly deeper, more intimate look into her unique methodology for those who are highly interested.
*   **Content:**
    *   A brief explanation of her core beliefs about leadership and personal growth.
    *   Reinforce the key pillars of her work (nervous system regulation, value alignment, etc.) but in a more personal, "from the heart" tone than on the homepage.
    *   This section can be slightly more "spiritual" or "philosophical" as the visitor is already highly engaged at this point.
*   **Headline:** `My Guiding Principles` or `My Philosophy`.

---

### **5. Call-to-Action (CTA)**

*   **Purpose:** To guide the now-connected and informed visitor to the next logical step.
*   **Structure:** A full-width section at the bottom of the page.
*   **Headline:** `Ready to Write Your Next Chapter?`
*   **Body:** A short, inviting paragraph.
*   **CTA Button:** `Explore Working With Me` (links to the Services page) or `Apply for a Clarity Call` (links directly to the contact/application page). The latter is more direct and recommended.
