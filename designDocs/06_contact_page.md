# 06: Contact Page Design Specification

The Contact Page should be simple, professional, and efficient. For a premium service, the goal is not just to be contacted, but to frame the contact as the first step in a high-value engagement. This design incorporates the strategic recommendation to position the initial call as an exclusive application.

**Guiding Principle:** Reduce friction while elevating the perception of value. Make it easy for the *right* people to connect.

### **1. Page Header Section**

*   **Purpose:** To set the tone for the interaction.
*   **Headline:** `Let's Connect` or `Start the Conversation`
*   **Sub-headline:** A sentence that clarifies the purpose of the page and sets expectations.
    *   *e.g., "The journey to embodied leadership begins with a single, confidential conversation. I look forward to hearing from you."*

### **2. Primary Call-to-Action: The Application**

*   **Purpose:** This is the core of the page. It frames the "free consultation" as a selective "Discovery Call" or "Clarity Call."
*   **Headline:** `Apply for a Complimentary Clarity Call`
*   **Body Text:** A short paragraph explaining the purpose and value of the call.
    *   *e.g., "This complimentary 30-minute call is designed for us to explore your goals, determine if we are a strong mutual fit, and outline what a transformative coaching engagement could look like for you. Please note that due to the deep nature of this work, I only take on a limited number of private clients. The application helps ensure we make the best use of our time together."*

### **3. Application Method: Embedded Scheduler**

*   **Purpose:** To eliminate the back-and-forth of scheduling and make it incredibly easy for a busy executive to book a time.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Embed a scheduling tool like **Calendly** or **SavvyCal** directly onto the page.
    *   The scheduler should be configured with a brief application form.
*   **Application Form Fields:** The form should be concise but effective at qualifying leads.
    *   Name
    *   Email
    *   Title & Company/Industry
    *   Website or LinkedIn Profile URL
    *   "What is the single biggest challenge you're hoping to solve right now?" (Open-ended question)
    *   "What are you hoping to achieve through our work together?" (Open-ended question)
    *   "How did you hear about me?"

---

### **4. Alternative Contact Methods**

*   **Purpose:** To provide options for general inquiries or media requests that are not applications for coaching.
*   **Layout:** A smaller, secondary section below the application/scheduler.
*   **Headline:** `For Other Inquiries`
*   **Content:**
    *   **General Inquiries:** `For general questions, please email [email protected]`
    *   **Media & Speaking:** `For media or speaking inquiries, please contact [email protected]`
    *   **Social Media:** Icons with links to relevant professional social media profiles (primarily LinkedIn).

---

### **5. Mini FAQ Section**

*   **Purpose:** To proactively answer common questions and address potential hesitations, further qualifying the applicant.
*   **Layout:** A simple, clean accordion-style FAQ.
*   **Sample Questions:**
    *   **"Who is this coaching for?"** (Briefly reiterate the ideal client profile).
    *   **"What is the investment?"** (You can either provide a starting range, e.g., "Private coaching engagements start at $X,XXX," or state that it will be discussed on the call, e.g., "The investment is discussed during the Clarity Call to ensure a tailored fit.").
    *   **"What is your confidentiality policy?"** (Reassure them of strict confidentiality, which is crucial for this audience).

---

### **6. Location & Final Details**

*   **Content:**
    *   Reiterate that coaching is conducted virtually, serving clients globally.
    *   A simple, professional closing statement.
