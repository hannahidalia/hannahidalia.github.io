### **1. Page Structure: A Content Hub**

*   **Purpose:** To create more than just a blog; to create a destination for resources.
*   **Layout:** The page should be clean, well-organized, and easy to navigate.
    *   **Featured Article/Resource:** The top of the page should feature the newest or most popular article with a large, compelling image.
    *   **Article Grid:** Below the featured article, display other articles in a clean grid or list format. Each entry should show:
        *   Featured Image
        *   Article Title
        *   Category
        *   A brief, engaging excerpt (1-2 sentences).
    *   **Sidebar:** The sidebar is a prime location for lead generation and navigation.

### **2. Sidebar Content**

*   **Purpose:** To provide navigation and conversion opportunities without cluttering the main content.
*   **Key Sidebar Elements:**
    *   **Lead Magnet CTA:** The most important element. This should be visually prominent, at the top of the sidebar.
        *   **Headline:** `Free Guide: The Executive's 5-Minute Reset`
        *   **Visual:** An image of the PDF or guide.
        *   **CTA:** A button (`Download Now`) that leads to a simple email capture form.
    *   **Search Bar:** Allow users to easily search for topics.
    *   **Categories:** A list of article categories (e.g., "Leadership," "Burnout Prevention," "Somatic Intelligence," "Case Studies") to allow for easy browsing.
    *   **Popular Posts:** A list of the most-viewed articles to guide new visitors to high-value content.
    *   **Secondary CTA:** A smaller, text-based CTA at the bottom of the sidebar.
        *   *e.g., "Ready to go deeper? Apply for a private Clarity Call."*

### **3. Article Page Template**

*   **Purpose:** To ensure each article is readable, engaging, and optimized for conversion.
*   **Layout:**
    *   **Clear Headline:** The title of the article.
    *   **Author/Date/Category:** Clearly displayed below the headline.
    *   **Featured Image:** A high-quality image at the top.
    *   **Readable Body Text:**
        *   Use a legible font size.
        *   Break up long text with subheadings, bullet points, and blockquotes.
        *   Keep paragraphs short.
    *   **In-line CTA:** Include a relevant, contextual CTA within the body of the article. For example, an article on burnout could have a CTA box linking to the Services page.
    *   **End-of-Article CTA:** Every article must end with a strong call-to-action. This is typically the primary lead magnet.
        *   *e.g., A visually distinct box with the "Free Guide" offer.*
    *   **Social Sharing Buttons:** Allow readers to easily share the content on platforms like LinkedIn.
    *   **Related Articles:** Show 2-3 other relevant articles at the bottom to keep the user engaged on the site.

### **4. Content Strategy (Article Topics)**

*   **Core Goal:** The topics should directly address the professional and personal challenges of women in high-stakes roles. The key is to provide immense value and actionable insights, proving that Hannah understands their world.
*   **Sample Article Titles (from original outline, refined):**
    *   "The High-Achiever's Paradox: Why Success Can Feel So Empty"
    *   "Beyond 'Pushing Through': How to Regulate Your Nervous System in a Crisis"
    *   "Somatic Intelligence: The Untapped Leadership Skill You Already Have"
    *   "How to Make Aligned Decisions When the Stakes are High"
    *   "Case Study: From Burnout to Breakthrough in 8 Weeks"

### **5. Lead Magnet Strategy**

*   **Purpose:** To convert anonymous blog readers into known leads by offering a high-value resource in exchange for an email address.
*   **Lead Magnet Ideas:**
    *   A downloadable PDF guide (e.g., "The 5-Minute Somatic Reset for Busy Leaders").
    *   A checklist (e.g., "The Pre-Meeting Grounding Checklist").
    *   A short video training or webinar.
*   **Delivery:** Once the user signs up, they should receive an automated email with a link to the resource. This also serves as the beginning of a welcome email sequence.
