# 03: Services Page Design Specification

The Services Page (or "Work With Me" page) must guide potential clients to the right offering without causing decision fatigue. The strategy is to simplify the choices and create a clear hierarchy, positioning the 1:1 coaching as the premier, flagship service.

**Guiding Principle:** Clarity over clutter. Make the client's decision-making process as simple as possible by focusing on the transformative outcomes of each core offering.

### **1. Page Header Section**

*   **Purpose:** To frame the page and set the context.

*   **Sub-headline:** A brief statement that reinforces the core value proposition.
    *   *e.g., "My programs are designed for leaders ready to do the deep work required for profound and lasting transformation. Explore the pathways below."*
