# 04: Testimonials / Case Studies Page Design Specification

The Testimonials Page (which could also be called "Client Stories," "Success Stories," or "Case Studies") is pure social proof. Its sole purpose is to build immense trust and credibility by showcasing the real-world results of Hannah's work. For the target audience, the credibility of the source is paramount.

**Guiding Principle:** Specificity builds credibility. Vague praise is forgettable; detailed, tangible results are compelling.

### **2. Featured Testimonial / Case Study**

*   **Purpose:** To immediately showcase the most powerful success story.
*   **Layout:** A prominent, visually distinct section at the top of the page.
*   **Content:**
    *   **Video First:** If a high-quality video testimonial is available, it should be featured here. Embed the video with a professional thumbnail.
    *   **If no video:** Use the strongest written testimonial.
    *   **Key Elements:**
        *   **Compelling Quote:** A powerful "pull quote" from the testimonial as the headline.
        *   **Client Details (The Credibility Builder):**
            *   Full Name
            *   Title (e.g., "CEO," "Founder," "Partner")
            *   Company or Industry (e.g., "of a $100M Investment Firm," "in Big Law," "in Tech")
            *   High-quality, professional headshot of the client.
        *   **The Story:** A longer-form testimonial that details the "before," the "process," and the "after." It should highlight the specific challenges the client faced and the tangible outcomes they achieved.

### **3. Testimonial Gallery**

*   **Purpose:** To provide a scannable gallery of additional testimonials.

    *   Client Headshot
    *   The most impactful sentence from their testimonial.
    *   Full Name, Title, and Company/Industry.
    *   A "Read More" link that expands to show the full testimonial.
*   **Actionable Tip for Gathering Testimonials:**
    *   When requesting testimonials, ask clients specific questions to guide their responses:
        *   "What was the single biggest challenge you were facing before we started working together?"
        *   "What was your biggest hesitation or doubt about this type of work?"
        *   "What has been the most significant change—professionally or personally—since our work together? Can you give a specific example?"
        *   "What would you say to another leader considering this work?"

    *   By Industry (e.g., "Finance," "Tech," "Law," "Healthcare")
    *   By Challenge (e.g., "Burnout," "Leadership Transition," "Team Performance")
