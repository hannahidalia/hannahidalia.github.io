# 01: Homepage Design Specification

The Homepage is the most critical page of the website. It serves as the primary entry point and must quickly communicate Hannah's value proposition, build credibility, and guide qualified visitors toward the primary call-to-action. This design merges the previous "Homepage" and "Landing Page" outlines into one cohesive, powerful page.

**Guiding Principle:** Every section should answer the visitor's core question: "Is this for me, and how will it solve my specific problem?"

---

### **1. Hero Section**

*   **Purpose:** To immediately capture the visitor's attention, state the core value proposition, and create an emotional connection.
*   **Visuals:** A high-quality, professional photograph or a short, looping video of Hannah that embodies "calm, strength, and empowerment." The aesthetic should be clean, professional, and serene.
*   **Headline:** Must be active and benefit-driven.
    *   **Primary Option:** `Unlock Your Leadership Potential Through Embodied Self-Mastery`
    *   **Alternative:** `The Leader’s Edge: Achieve Unshakeable Presence and Master High-Stakes Decisions`
*   **Sub-headline:** Briefly explains who it's for and what it solves, using the audience's language.
    *   *e.g., "A private coaching program for women executives and founders who are ready to move beyond burnout and lead with authentic power, clarity, and impact."*
*   **Primary Call-to-Action (CTA):** The button should be prominent and use clear, compelling language.
    *   **Text:** `Apply for a Clarity Call`
    *   **Note:** Using "Apply" and "Clarity Call" positions the offering as exclusive and high-value, filtering for serious inquiries.

### **2. Social Proof / "As Seen In" Bar**

### **3. The Problem & The Promise Section**

*   **Purpose:** To show the visitor that you deeply understand their specific struggles and to introduce your solution in a compelling way.
*   **Structure:** Two columns or a "before-and-after" narrative.
*   **The Problem (Headline: `Are you a successful leader who feels...`):**
    *   Use bullet points to list relatable pain points.
    *   *e.g., "Constantly 'on' and heading towards burnout?", "Doubting your decisions despite a track record of success?", "Feeling disconnected from the work that once fulfilled you?", "Successful on paper, but unfulfilled in reality?"*
*   **The Promise (Headline: `It doesn't have to be this way.`):**
    *   Introduce the vision of a new way of leading.
    *   *e.g., "Imagine leading from a place of deep inner knowing and unshakeable calm. Making your biggest decisions with clarity and confidence. Driving impact not from a place of pressure, but from a place of authentic alignment."*

### **4. The Solution: "Why This is Different"**

*   **Purpose:** To explain Hannah's unique methodology by translating its concepts into tangible leadership benefits. This is where we bridge the "spiritual" and "corporate" gap.
*   **Headline:** `A New Paradigm for Leadership: The Embodied Self-Mastery Method`
*   **Content:** Use 3-4 feature blocks with icons. Each block translates a "therapeutic" concept into a leadership outcome.
    *   **Block 1 (Nervous System Regulation):**
        *   **Headline:** `Master Your Physiology Under Pressure`
        *   **Body:** "We go beyond mindset. Using advanced somatic techniques, you will learn to regulate your nervous system. The result is enhanced clarity, improved decision-making in high-stakes situations, and the ability to remain grounded amidst chaos."
    *   **Block 2 (Inner Alignment):**
        *   **Headline:** `Lead from Your Core Values`
        *   **Body:** "This work isn't about adding more strategies; it's about uncovering your innate wisdom. We'll work to align your leadership with your core values, leading to more authentic impact, deeper fulfillment, and a renewed sense of purpose."
    *   **Block 3 (Addressing Root Causes):**
        *   **Headline:** `Resolve the Deep Patterns of Self-Doubt`
        *   **Body:** "We address the deep-seated, often unconscious patterns that lead to burnout and impostor syndrome. By resolving these at the root, you unlock a new level of confidence and presence that permeates every aspect of your life and leadership."

### **5. How It Works (The Process)**

    1.  **Step 1: Apply for a Clarity Call:** "Submit a confidential application to explore if this work is a mutual fit."
    2.  **Step 2: The Deep Dive:** "Embark on a personalized 1:1 coaching journey tailored to your unique goals and challenges."
